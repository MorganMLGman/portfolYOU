description: As you might have noticed, the site you're looking at is not just a static website &#128064. It was created using the popular Jekyll framework, which is used by a lot of really BIG companies. You might have also noticed that the site address is not <code>[nickname].github.io</code>, this is because the site is not hosted using GitHub Pages, which is the fastest way to put up a site created in Jekyll. This site is hosted on a private server &#128526, you probably wouldn't even notice it if it weren't for that unusual <code>morganmlg.com</code> address, right? You can learn more about my self-hosting interests on the <strong>"Homelab"</strong> tab.
