description: Hire A Babysitter was my project for an engineering thesis. The main goal of this project was to create a platform like <strong>pracuj.pl</strong> or <strong>olx.pl/praca</strong>, but exclusive for babysitters and parents in need. The project included features like direct messages, acceptance of announcements, issuing opinions for employees and employers, rate negotiations, filtering and searching for announcements using the ElasticSearch engine.
